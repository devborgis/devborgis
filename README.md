## About Me

I am an enthusiastic programmer, teacher, and co-founder of Spote Brasil. My main skills include programming in Object Pascal using Delphi and Lazarus, as well as database management. I have a passion for the intricacies of programming, focusing on the logic and processes that occur behind the scenes in applications rather than the visual aspects.

## Projects 

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Custom Report Tool** | Developed a custom reporting tool using FastReport, compatible with different databases. |
| **WebSocket Client** | Created a WebSocket client for communication between web and desktop applications within the Spote, Saifer, and other ecosystems. |
